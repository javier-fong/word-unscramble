# Word Unscramble
There are different levels of difficulties (easy, medium, hard and insane). You will have to rearrange the letters to form a word and each difficulty will have a limit on the number of letters. 

The game could serve as an educational purpose as well, as user could learn new english words they have never heard about.

## Project Demo
**Word Unscramble** is available to try on [https://redgreenblues.github.io/word-unscramble/]()

## Technology
These technologies were used to create **Word Unscramble**:
 - **HTML5**, **CSS3**, & **JavaScript**
 - **jQuery** were used to manage DOM manipulation
 - **AJAX** were used to request and access data from the [API library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary/master/dictionary.json)

## Unsolved Problems
There are a few functions that can be improved or added upon:
 - Adding a **user registration and login page**, so that user is able to create a username
 - By utilizing the username created by the user, a **scoreboard** could be created to keep track of the user's score
 - Further creation of a **ranking system** to rank individual user score
 - Further improvement on the **logic to enable different answers to a single question**, instead of only one answer. This is because there are several cases where different words could be formed using the same letters
