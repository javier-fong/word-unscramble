## Approach and Process

#### My process and approach
- Understanding what is the project scope and the requirements of the project
- Brainstormed ideas that were suitable for the project and narrowed down to a few ideas
- Choosing Word Unscramble game as my project given my own capabilities and time span
- Crafted out a wireframe and began working on the HTML and CSS
- Once the layout of the game is up, I began to work on the JavaScript and jQuery, one step at a time beginning from the main page to the last page
- Along the way, went through a few YouTube videos, Codepen links and Google to get reference and assistance from the game logic

#### What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
My wireframe and plan did not take into account of adding improvements into the game. This leads to difficulties in adding new functions into the game because a new function takes up a space in the layout (e.g. timer function), thus more time is needed to manipulate the DOM to accomodate a new function to suit the aesthetics that I wanted. 

I would need to plan the full structure of the game carefully before proceeding, and at the same time, if there are improvements to be made, it will be easier to add in.

#### What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
- I knew what was my capability at that point of time, hence I chose an idea that were within my own capability and completed the project within the time span
- It is easier to code the logic when you fully understand what your game is about and the goal of your game
- YouTube, Codepen, Google helps a lot in my coding and they are indispensable


## Code and Code Design

#### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
Understanding the code better and how it works ($.AJAX(), promise.then() for example). A lot of time (50% - 60% of total time spent) was spent trying to debug what went wrong because I do not fully understand how it works.

Once this was sorted out, it was easier to code the rest of the game.

#### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
- Refactored and organized the code so that it is more presentable and easier to understand
- Organized the code to perform 1 task in 1 function as well
- Commenting on each function to know what is the task of the function

## Unit 1 Post Mortem

#### What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Using Google and asking my buddy (Alvis) and TA (Wilfred) for assistance whenever I hit a roadblock after multiple tries to resolve the problem.  

#### What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Sometimes, after a lesson, I don't really understand what it is about. I had to watch YouTube tutorials to understand the topic.

I could try to go through the lessons beforehand to understand it better during class.

#### How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
1. The difficulty of unit 1 is acceptable

2. There were quite a few instances where I do not understand what the topic is about and it was confusing at times. I hope the explanation will be better

3. I hope there is a 'model' or sample answer for our homework. As a student and a beginner in coding, there was a lot of repeat code in my coding and most of the time I do not know how to make it DRY. Since we need to practice DRY principle, there should be a 'model' answer for our homework so we could understand and apply the concept better
